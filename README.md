# Applied Geodata Science

This repository contains the source code for the textbook and tutorial of the course *Applied Geodata Science*, taught as part of the Geography and the Climate Sciences study programs at the University of Bern, Switzerland.

The course introduces the typical data science workflow using various examples of geographical and environmental data. With a strong hands-on component and a series of input lectures, the course introduces the basic concepts of data science and teaches how to conduct each step of the data science workflow. This includes the handling of various data formats, the formulation and fitting of robust statistical models, including basic machine learning algorithms, the effective visualization and communication of results, and the implementation of reproducible workflows, founded in Open Science principles. The overall course goal is to teach students to tell a story with data.
