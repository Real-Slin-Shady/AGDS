## Tutorial

### Working with R and RStudio

R is a free, open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that makes it easy to use R for data analysis and visualization.

#### Installing R and RStudio

To use R and RStudio, you will first need to download and install them on your computer.

-   To install R, go to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/) and download the latest version of R for your operating system. Once the download is complete, follow the on-screen installation instructions for your operating system to install R.

-   To install RStudio, go to the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and download the latest version of RStudio for your operating system. Once the download is complete, follow the installation instructions for your operating system to install RStudio.

#### The RStudio interface

RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for writing, running, and debugging R code. When you open RStudio, you will see the following:

![RStudio interface.](figures/RStudio_interface_screenshot.png)

The interface is divided into four main panels:

-   The **source editor** is where you can write, edit, and save your R code.
-   The **console** is where you can enter R commands and see the output.
-   The **environment** panel shows you the objects (variables, data frames, etc.) that are currently in your R session, as well as their values.
-   The **files, plots, help, etc.** panel shows you the files, plots, and other items that are currently in your R workspace, as well as help and documentation for R functions and packages. We will cover this in more detail later in this course.

#### Running R code

Once you have both programs installed, you can open RStudio and begin a new *R session*. To run R code using R Studio, follow these steps:

-   In the *source editor* panel, type your R code.
-   To run the code, you can either press the **Run** button or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Command + Enter (Mac).
-   The code will be executed in the *console* panel, and any output will be displayed there.
-   Alternatively, you can directly type single-statement R commands in the console and run them by pressing Enter.

For example, let's say you want to calculate the sum of the numbers 1, 2, and 3. You can write the following code in the source editor:

```{r}
# Calculate the sum of 1, 2, and 3
1 + 2 + 3
```

Then, you can press the **Run** button or use the keyboard shortcut to run the code. The output will be displayed in the console:

        > 1 + 2 + 3
        [1] 6

#### Base R operations

The R `base` package contains the basic functions which let R function as a programming language: arithmetic, input/output, basic programming support, etc. Its contents are always available when you start an R session. Here we introduce the main binary operators, which work on vectors, matrices and scalars.

Arithmetic operators:

-   `+` addition
-   `-` subtraction
-   `*` multiplication
-   `/` division
-   `^` or `**` exponentiation

Logical operators:

-   `>` greater than
-   `>=` greater than or equal to
-   `==` exactly equal to
-   `<` less than
-   `<=` less than or equal to
-   `!=` not equal

#### Working directory

The *working directory* is the default location to which R writes to and reads files from, and you can specify it by going to **Session \> Set Working Directory...** and navigating to your desired folder. Alternatively, you can check what is your current working directory or change it by entering the following in the console:

```{r eval = FALSE}
getwd()         # get working directory
setwd("~/agds") # set working directory
```

Ideally, the working directory is a folder containing only the files relevant to your data analysis project.

### R objects

In addition to running single statements in the R console, the output of a statement can be saved as a new *object*. There are many kinds of R objects, some of which are covered here and in future chapters.

#### Types of data

First, we will introduce the different types of data that one can encounter. We can classify statistical variables according to what values they take.

-   *Numerical*: These statistical variables can be measured quantitatively and their value is a number.
    -   *Continuous*: We say that a variable is continuous when it can take an infinite number of real values within an interval (for example, the altitude of a mountain). One could consider unbounded variables (temperature) or restricted variables, like positive variables (weight of a person) or an interval (a proportion between 0 and 1).
    -   *Discrete*: When the variable can only take a finite number of values in an interval, we say it is discrete. A common example is count data, like the population of a city.
-   *Categorical*: The values are characteristics that cannot be quantified.
    -   *Binary*: These variables have two possible values: TRUE or FALSE (a variable indicating whether the person has siblings or not).
    -   *Nominal*: They describe a name, label or category without natural order (for example the name of a person).
    -   *Ordinal*: Like their name indicates, ordinal variables are categorical and follow a natural order. For example, "terrible", "bad", "neutral", "good", "great". A numerical variable can sometimes be discretized and put into categories, like dividing people into age groups "toddler", "child", "teenager", "adult".

Next, we will see how these different types of variables can be treated in R.

#### Variables and classes

In R, a *variable* is a named location in memory that stores a value. To create a variable, you simply assign a value to a name using the `<-` operator (or the `=` operator, which is equivalent, but `<-` is preferred). For example:

```{r}
my_variable <- 5
```

This code creates a variable called `my_variable` and assigns the value `5` to it. You can access the value of a variable or any other object by simply referring to its name, like this:

```{r}
my_variable
```

When you run this code, the value of `my_variable` will be printed to the console. Running `print(my_variable)` is an alternative syntax, using the `print()` function.

In R, every object and value has a *class* that determines how it is stored and how it behaves. For example, the `5` in our example above is a number, so its class is `numeric`. To find out the class of a value or a variable, you can use the `class()` function, like this:

```{r}
class(5)
class(my_variable)
```

The most basic classes are:

-   `numeric` (`num`) - any real number, e.g. 2.375
-   `integer` (`int`) - integer numbers, e.g. 2
-   `character` (`chr`) - any string, e.g. "fluxes"
-   `logical` (`logi`) - binary, i.e. `TRUE`/`FALSE` values
-   `factor` (`Factor`) - categorical data, the variable can only be one of a defined amount of options, e.g. female/male/other. Factors can also be given an order.
-   `function` - a set of statements organized to perform a specific task, for example `mean()`

By default, any number is coerced as `"numeric"`. So if you want an integer value to have class `"integer"`, you need to specify it like this:

```{r}
my_variable <- as.integer(5)
class(my_variable)
```

Sometimes you need to convert the class of an object, for example turning a `"integer"` number into a `"character"`. You can do so as follows:

```{r}
my_variable <- as.character(my_variable)
my_variable
class(my_variable)
```

Notice that now the values are in quotes `"5"`. This way, R interprets it as a text and you will not be able to do any numeric calculations with it anymore.

#### Vectors

A *vector* in R is a sequence of data elements of the same class. Vectors can be created with the `c()` function, which stands for *concatenate*, i.e., to link together in a series or chain. For example, the following code creates a numeric vector:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

To access the elements of a vector, you can use the square bracket notation. For example, the following code retrieves the second element of the vector `x`:

```{r}
x[2]
```

You can also use the square bracket notation to extract a sub-vector from a larger vector. For example, you can extract the second to fourth elements of the vector x:

```{r}
x[2:4]
```

Another useful property of vectors in R is that they can be easily combined using arithmetic operators. For example, adding the elements of two vectors `x` and `y` element-wise:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5, 6)
x + y
```

R also supports vectors of other classes, for example character vectors. Since all elements must be of the same class, the most general class will be adopted. The following code concatenates the vectors `x` and `y`, followed by new character elements:

```{r}
z <- c(x, y, "seven", "eight")
z
class(z)
```

Operations on vectors are performed element-wise. For example, if we ask what numbers in `x` are greater than 2, we obtain a vector of logical values (and class `"logical"`):

```{r}
x > 2
```

#### Lists

*Lists* are another R object, of class `"list"`. They are extremely flexible. They allow us to store different types of data, even if they are of different lengths or classes. They are created with the function `list()` and can be named or not. Here is an example where each element of the list is named.

```{r}
mylist <- list(
    temperatures = c(2.234, 1.987, 4.345), 
    my_favourite_function = mean, 
    best_course = "Applied Geodata Science"
    )
```

Similar to vectors, we can extract elements from lists, either by index `[[1]]` or by the name using `[["temperatures"]]` or `$temperatures`. Note the double `[[]]` here, indicating an element of a list as opposed to `[]` indicating an element of a vector. To get the entire vector of temperatures, do either of the three:

```{r}
mylist[[1]]
mylist[["temperatures"]]
mylist$temperatures
```

And to get the first temperature value:

```{r}
mylist[["temperatures"]][1]
```

You can also append elements to the list (either way is possible):

```{r}
mylist[["my_second_favourite_function"]] <- median
mylist$my_second_favourite_function <- median
```

This was a very condensed introduction to vectors and lists. A more complete introduction is given [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html).

#### Data frames

A *data frame*, of class `"data.frame"`, is a tightly coupled collection of variables which share many of the properties of matrices and of lists, used as the fundamental data structure in R. You can think of a data frame as a table. The content of each data frame column is a vector. Columns need to be of the same length and all values in a column need to be of the same data type.

A data frame can be created as follows:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(name = c("Maria", "Peter", "Alex"),
                 age = c(13, 56, 30))
df
```

The elements of a data frame can be accessed the same way that we treated lists, with each column being one element of the list. To get the vector of ages:

```{r}
df$age
```

Furthermore, they can be treated as a *matrix*. Notice that the first index refers to rows and the second to columns. For example:

```{r}
df[, 1]   # first column
df[2, ]   # second row
df[2,2]   # age of Peter
```

There are many more things you can do with data frames. Since they are central to analyzing data with R, we go into more detail in [Tutorial 2](#programming_primers) and have dedicated all of [Tutorial 3](#data_wrangling) to teach you how to work with data frames in a tidy way.

#### Functions

R *functions* can be applied to an object (or several objects) and return another object. For example the `mean()` function can take a numeric vector as input and output the mean of its values.

```{r}
mean(df$age)
```

Functions are also R objects and have class `"function"`. They are covered in more detail in [Tutorial 2](#programming_primers).

#### Missing values

R has two representations for missing values: `NA` and `NULL`. Similar objects also exist in other programming languages.

`NA` is an identifyer to mark missing data and stands for *not available*. You will encounter this when reading data into a data frame, and some of its cells show `NA` because that value is missing. Also, if you ask for the 4th element of a vector of length 3, R returns `NA`.

```{r}
x[4]
```

Almost all operations on vectors where at least one value is `NA` also return `NA`. For example:

```{r}
mean(c(1, 2, NA))
```

To remove all missing values in the function evaluation, the common argument to set in the respective function call is `na.rm`. By default, it is usually set to `FALSE`, but we can do:

```{r}
mean(c(1, 2, NA), na.rm = TRUE)
```

Furthermore, `NA` counts as an element in vectors. A variable assigned just `NA` would have length 1 (of class `"logical"`) and the vector above has length 3, as can be determined using the `length()` function, and has class `"numeric"`.

By contrast, `NULL` is the R null object or empty space. You can also assign `NULL` to a variable, which will have length zero because it is empty. Functions may return `NULL` when no output was defined, or if an error occurred.

#### R environment

The set of objects (variables, data frames, etc.) defined during an R session are referred to as the *environment*. You can view the objects in RStudio in the **environment** panel in R Studio, grouped as Data, Values and Functions.

After closing an existing R session (e.g., after quitting RStudio), the environment defined by the used during that session will not be saved automatically and will be lost. To save your environment, go to the **Session** menu and select **Save Workspace As...**. This will save all your objects in a `.RData` file in your working directory. However, this is not recommended. Next, we will go over some more sophisticated ways of writing code and saving your progress.

#### Read and save data

The function `save()` allows to save multiple R objects of any form as a single `.RData` file. This is how the environment of your R session is saved. This is how we would save several R objects:

```{r eval=FALSE}
save(df, df_small, file = "data/data_frames.RData")
```

`.RData` files are read into your environment using the `load()` function, rather than `read()`. This function loads the objects with the name that they were saved with.

```{r eval=FALSE}
load("data/data_frames.RData")
```

Alternatively, the function `saveRDS()` allows you save individual R objects of any form (not just a data frame). `saveRDS()` creates a binary file that is fast to write and read, but only intelligible to R. Such files are commonly identified by the suffix `.rds`. It is recommended to name the `.rds` files according to the single object they contain. For example:

```{r, eval=F}
saveRDS(df_small, file = "data/df_small.rds")
```

This file can then be read into your R environment. We need to assign a name to the object read, otherwise it will be just printed to the console but not loaded into the R environment. Sometimes, it is useful to give it a new name, for example:

```{r, eval=F}
df_small_2 <- readRDS("data/df_small.rds")
```

### R scripts

Usually, multiple statements are needed to get, e.g., from reading data into R to final numbers and figures that make up a further analysis. Together, these multiple statements constitute a *workflow*. It is essential that all workflows that underlie results of publications are *reproducible*, that is, that another person can replicate your results using your code and certain data.

To make a workflow reproducible, the sequence of statements that you needed to carry out your analysis and produce outputs can be saved as an R *script*. A script is a text file named with the suffix `.R` to indicate that it is executable by R. It contains a sequence of R commands, which you can run all at once or one at a time. These commands will always be run line-by-line, starting from the top.

To create a new script in RStudio, go to the **File** menu and select **New File \> R Script**. This will open a new script file in the source editor. You can then type your R code in the script file and save it to your computer.

To run a script, you can either use the **Source** button in the source editor or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + Enter (Windows) or Command + Shift + Enter (Mac). This will run all of the commands in the script file, in the order they are written, in the console. Alternatively, you can type into the console:

    > source("my_r_script.R")

Note that, to be able to run the code above, the file `my_r_script.R` must be in your curretn working directory.

You can find more useful information about scripts and workflows in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-scripts.html) [@Wickham2017R].

We should always strive to write nice scripts and good code. Good code is clean, readable, consistent, and extensible (easily modified or adapted). To achieve this, here are a few points to consider - inspired by [best practices for coding](https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-code-best-practices/) and by the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) [@wickham_welcome_nodate].

#### Structure your script

At the beginning of each file add a **header** as a fully commented text section, describing what the code contains, and how it fits into the larger analysis framework.

Note that Git stores all meta information about the file, including who created it, who modified it and when. This information should not be added to the header. Then, load all libraries needed within the script. Then, source any scripts and load data, and only then, start with the sequence of statements. To visually separate parts, break up your code using, commented lines.

For example, a script could look like this:

<!-- For this chapter, we will mostly work with functions already integrated into R directly, also known as *base R*. Additionally, you will work with functions from the [*tidyverse*](https://www.tidyverse.org/). *tidyverse* is a collection of packages specifically designed for writing efficient data science workflows. Code written for the tidyverse follows its own "dialect" within the R langague. It will be introduced in @ref(ch-02). -->

```{r eval=FALSE, message=F}
#////////////////////////////////////////
# Demonstrating script structure
#---------------------------------------

#----Load packages, functions and data
library(tidyverse)
source("R/my_functions.R")
my_df <- read_csv("data/my_df.csv")
#---------------------------------------
# Main part
#---------------------------------------
# convert units
my_df$temp <- my_df$temp + 273.15  # deg C -> K
#---------------------------------------
# Writing output
#---------------------------------------
filn <- "data/my_df_kelvin.csv"
print(paste("Writing file", filn, "..."))
write_csv(my_df, filn)
```

#### Comments

Adding comments in the code helps to explain exactly what the code is doing and why. This makes it easy to understand and modify the code, and can be key when debugging. In R source files, comments are prefixed with a `#`, which means that all what is right of the `#` is not interpreted by R.

Avoid redundant comments like the one below. Instead, comments should explain the "why" of that chunk of code, not the "what" or "how".

```{r eval=F}
# take the mean 
myvar_mean <- mean(myvar)
```

#### Spaces and breaks

Adding enough white spaces and line breaks in the right locations greatly helps the legibility of any code. Cramping it up too much leads to an unintelligible sequence of characters and it will not be clear what parts go together (operators, variable names, brackets). Therefore, consider the following points:

-   Use spaces around operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, `>`, etc.).
-   Use `<-`, not `=`, for allocating a value to a variable.
-   An opening curly bracket (`{`) should be followed by a line break and never stand alone on a line. A closing curly bracket (`}`) should stand alone on a line unless followed by `else`.
-   Code inside curly brackets should be *indented* (recommended: two white spaces at the beginning of each line for each indentation level - don't use tabs).

For example, well written code looks like this:

```{r eval=F}
if (temp > 5.0){
  growth_temp <- growth_temp + temp  
}
```

#### Variable naming

It is preferable to use concise and descriptive variable names. Different variable naming styles are being used. In this course, we use lowercase letters, and underscores (`_`) to separate words within a name (`_`). Avoid (`.`) as they are reserved for S3 objects (base R). Also, you should avoid naming your objects with names of common functions and variables since your re-definition will mask already defined object names.

For example, `df_daily` is a data frame with data at a daily resolution. Or `clean_daily` is a function that cleans daily data. Note that a verb is used as a name for a function and an underscore (`_`) is used to separate words.

It is also recommendable to avoid variable names consisting of only one character. This makes it practically impossible to search for that variable.

```{r eval=F}
# Good
day_01
# Bad
DayOne
day.one
first_day_of_the_month
djm1
# Very bad
mean <- function(x) sum(x)/length(x) # mean() itself is already a function
T <- FALSE # T is an abbreviation of TRUE
c <- 10 # c() is used to create a vector (example <- c(1, 2, 3))
```

#### R Markdown

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files are an enhanced version of scripts. They combine formatted text and executable code chunks. They can either be compiled (*knitted*) into an HTML or PDF output, where code chunks are executed upon compilation and visualization outputs are directly placed into the output, or they can be run like a script entirely or each code chunk separately. When run (not knitted), objects defined by the executed code are available in the environment.

Text can be formatted using the [Markdown syntax](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html). For example, a top-level section title is specified by `#` and a title of a section one level lower by `##`.

R Markdown documents are also the basis of this book, with each chapter written in a separate R Markdown file. This lets you use the book in an interactive fashion.

When opened in RStudio, you can knit an R Markdown document by clicking the **Knit** button at the top of the source panel. To run the chunks of code in an R Markdown file, you can click on the **Run** button also on the source panel and select an option from the drop-down menu. For example, **Run All** runs all the chunks in the document. Alternatively, individual chunks can be executed by clicking the green right-pointing triangle in the upper right corner of each chunk.

![R Markdown document opened in the source panel.](figures/RMarkdown.png)

### Workspace management

Using *R projects* in combination with Git (covered in [Tutorial 6](#code_mgmt)) is the essence of efficient workspace management in R. All files that belong together are organised within one directory. This can be regarded as the project directory and is typically congruent with what belongs to the respective Git repository. By keeping an organized workspace, another person (or your future self) can find relevant files, run your code and reproduce your analysis workflow easily.

#### R projects

RStudio also allows you to work with R projects. An R project is a collection of files and folders that you use for a specific analysis or data project. An R project makes it easier to organize and manage your files and keep track of your work.

To create a new R project, go to the **File** menu and select **New Project...**. This will open the *New Project* dialog, where you can choose where to save your project and what type of project to create. The current project that you are working on is shown on the upper right corner of the RStudio interface. Here you can also switch between existing projects or create a new one.

![R Project menu.](figures/RStudio_RProject_screenshot.png)

When starting a new project, a file `<project_name.Rproj>` is created. It sits in the project directory and stores information about your last session (settings, open files, etc.) and optionally (not recommended) the environment of that session. The use of R projects also automatically enables useful features in RStudio for easy package, website, or book building and lets you manage Git for the repository corresponding to the project.

When you want to continue working on an existing R project, you can start a new session by clicking on your `<project_name.Rproj>` file. This restores settings from your last R session, including the variables in your environment, and sets your working directory to the project directory. Nevertheless, we recommend to start by emptying your environment and loading your data and variables using the code you previously wrote. That way, you ensure that your results are reproducible.

#### Folder structure

Once you have created an R project, you can create new scripts and other files within the project. These files will be organized in a folder structure, which you can view and manage in the **files, plots, help, etc.** panel.

For example, keep source files where R functions are defined in `./R` (where . refers to the current project directory), data files in `./data` and visualizations in `./fig`. It's advisable to write output files, created by the code of your project, to sub-directories within the project directory. To read and write from/to files you should use relative paths (relative to the project's root directory), like any of the two equivalent following options:

    > source("./R/my_r_script.R")
    > source("R/my_r_script.R")

A project directory should only contain code, data and outputs that belong to this one project. Stuff that may belong to multiple projects should be kept somewhere else. For example, keep original data (e.g., the raw data files that you created when collecting the data in the field, or data files you downloaded from the web) outside the project directory. Exceptions are small data files, which you can keep in `./data_raw`.

It is advisable to create a separate data directory outsidethe project (e.g., `~/data/`, where \~ refers to your home directory) that holds all the original data you ever downloaded, or obtained from peers, or gathered yourself. Within such a data directory, you can put files from different sources into separate sub-directories and add a description file (e.g., `~/data/some_data_source/README`) defining by whom, from where and when the data was obtained and defining data use policy.

You can find an [R project template](https://github.com/computationales/R_proj_template) in the GECO GitHub page. It shows an example of how you can organize your files into folders. Using such a template removes the overhead of designing a structure for each new project and can help you keep your work organized and make it easier to reuse and share your code.
