## Learning objectives

After you've gone over the lecture and solved the exercises, you should be able to:

- Work with R and RStudio on your computer
- Organize your workspace, using R projects
- Use R libraries, other libraries and applications
- Save your code and progress in an organized way

## Tutorial

In this first tutorial, we will install R and RStudio and introduce how to use RStudio to run R code. We will learn to load and use R libraries. Finally, we will explain what an R workspace is and how to manage it, including how to save your coding progress.

### Installing R and RStudio

R is a free, open-source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that makes it easy to use R for data analysis and visualization.

To use R and RStudio, you will first need to download and install them on your computer.

- To install R, go to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/) and download the latest version of R for your operating system. Once the download is complete, follow the on-screen installation instructions for your operating system to install R.

- To install RStudio, go to the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and download the latest version of RStudio for your operating system. Once the download is complete, follow the installation instructions for your operating system to install RStudio.

### Using RStudio

Once you have installed R and RStudio, you can start using RStudio to write and run R code. RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for writing, running, and debugging R code.

#### The RStudio interface

When you open RStudio, you will see the following interface:

![RStudio interface.](figures/RStudio_interface_screenshot.png)

The interface is divided into four main panels:

- The **source editor** is where you can write, edit, and save your R code.
- The **console** is where you can enter R commands and see the output.
- The **environment** panel shows you the objects (variables, data frames, etc.) that are currently in your R session, as well as their values.
- The **files, plots, help, etc.** panel shows you the files, plots, and other items that are currently in your R workspace, as well as help and documentation for R functions and packages. We will cover this in more detail later in this course.

#### Writing and running R code

To write and run R code, follow these steps:

- In the **source editor** panel, type your R code.
- To run the code, you can either press the **Run** button or use the **keyboard shortcut** Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Command + Enter (Mac).
- The code will be executed in the *console* panel, and any output will be displayed there.
- Alternatively, you can directly type R commands in the console and run them by pressing Enter.

For example, let's say you want to calculate the sum of the numbers 1, 2, and 3. You can write the following code in the source editor:
```{r}
# Calculate the sum of 1, 2, and 3
1 + 2 + 3
```

Then, you can press the *Run* button or use the keyboard shortcut to run the code. The output will be displayed in the console:
```{}
> 1 + 2 + 3
[1] 6
```

### Variables and classes

In R, a variable is a named location in memory that stores a value. To create a variable, you simply assign a value to a name using the `<-` operator (or the `=` operator, which is equivalent, but `<-` is preferred). For example:

```{r}
my_variable <- 5
```

This code creates a variable called `my_variable` and assigns the value `5`  to it. You can access the value of a variable by simply referring to its name, like this:

```{r}
my_variable
```

When you run this code, the value of `my_variable` will be printed to the console.

In R, every value has a **class** that determines how it is stored and how it behaves. For example, the `5` in our example above is an integer, so its class is `integer`. To find out the class of a value or a variable, you can use the `class()` function, like this:

```{r}
class(5) # returns "integer"
class(my_variable)
```

The most common classes in R are `numeric` (for numbers), `integer`, `character` (for text), and `logical` (for `TRUE`/`FALSE` values). Furthermore, variables can also be assigned vectors, matrices, data.frames or many other R objects.

```{r}
class("hello") # returns "character"
class(c(1, 2, 3)) # returns "numeric"
```

### Workspace management

Your **R workspace** is where you store the objects (variables, data frames, etc.) that you create while working with R. You can view the objects in your workspace in the **environment** panel.

To save your workspace, go to the **Session** menu and select **Save Workspace As...***. This will save your workspace in a `.RData` file in your working directory.

#### Working with scripts and R projects

In addition to running R code directly in the console, you can also save your code as a script. A script is a text file that contains a sequence of R commands, which you can run all at once or one at a time.

To create a new script in RStudio, go to the **File** menu and select **New File > R Script**. This will open a new script file in the **source** editor. You can then type your R code in the script file and save it to your computer.

To run a script, you can either use the Source button in the source editor or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + Enter (Windows) or Command + Shift + Enter (Mac). This will run all of the commands in the script file, in the order they are written, in the console.

In addition to scripts, RStudio also allows you to work with R projects. An R project is a collection of files and folders that you use for a specific analysis or data project. An R project makes it easier to organize and manage your files and keep track of your work.

To create a new R project, go to the **File** menu and select **New Project...**. This will open the New Project dialog, where you can choose where to save your project and what type of project to create.

When starting a new project, a file `<project_name.Rproj>` is created. It sits in the project directory and stores

Once you have created an R project, you can create new scripts and other files within the project. These files will be organized in a folder structure, which you can view and manage in the files, plots, help, etc. panel.

Working with scripts and R projects can help you keep your work organized and make it easier to reuse and share your code.

#### Organizing your files



###Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the basics of using R and RStudio for geographic data analysis. We have shown how to install and use R and RStudio, and we have discussed how to manage your workspace and work with scripts and R projects.

R and RStudio are powerful tools for data analysis and visualization, and we hope this tutorial has provided a good introduction to using them for geographic data.
