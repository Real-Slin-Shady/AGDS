# About this book {.unnumbered}

This book accompanies the course(s) *Applied Geodata Science*, taught at the Institute of Geography, University of Bern.

## Target readers of this book

The target of this book are people interested in applying data science methods for research. Methods introduced, example data sets, and prediction challenges are chosen to make the book relate most to scientists in Geography and Environmental Sciences. No prior knowledge in working with code, or R in particular, are required. Brief introductions into the fundamentals are given in Chapters \@ref(getting_started) and \@ref(programming_primers).

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The sheer volume of data that is becoming available now bears a huge potential for answering long-standing questions in all fields of environmental and geo-sciences. This gives rise to a new set of tools that can be used and a new set of challenges when applying them. This course teaches you the basic concepts, methods, and tools for your future data science projects in environmental sciences - in academia and in the wild. The course thus prepares you to benefit from the general data richness in environmental and geo-sciences.

The course introduces the typical data science workflow using various examples of geographical and environmental data. With a strong hands-on component and a series of input lectures, the course introduces the basic concepts of data science and teaches how to conduct each step of the data science workflow. This includes the handling of various data formats, the formulation and fitting of robust statistical models, including basic machine learning algorithms, the effective visualisation and communication of results, and the implementation of reproducible workflows, founded in Open Science principles. The overall course goal is to teach students to tell a story with data.

All tutorials use the R programming language.

## What is Applied Geodata Science?

-   What is Data Science?
-   Why "Applied Geo-" Data Science?

## The (data) science workflow {#data-science-workflow}

The red thread of this course is the *data science workflow*. Applied (geodata-) data science projects typically start with research questions and hypotheses, and some data at hand, and (ideally) end with an answer to the research questions. What lies in between is not a linear process, but a cycle. One has to "understand" the data in order to identify appropriate analyses for answering the research questions. Such an understanding of the data is gradually established by repeated cycles of transforming the data, visualizing it, and modelling relationships. Before we've visualized the data, we don't know how to transform it. And before we've modeled it, we don't know the most appropriate visualization. In practice, we approach answers to our research questions gradually, through repeated cycles of *exploratory data analysis* [Fig. data-science-workflow].

[Fig. data-science-workflow]

As we work our way through repeated cycles of exploratory data analysis (Chapter \@ref(data-science-workflow)), we take decisions based on our data analysis, modelling, and visualizations. And we write code. The final conclusions we draw, the answers to research questions we find, and the results we communicate rest on the combination of all steps of our data processing, analysis, and visualization. Simply put, it rests on the reproducibility (and legibility) of our code. This course teaches you the tools and concepts to effectively learn from (large volumes of) data, and to put reproducibility of a geodata science project into practice.

## Why now? {#data-rich-era}

Three general developments set the stage for this course. First, Geography and Environmental Sciences (as many other realms of today's world) have entered a **data-rich era** (Chapters \@ref(data_variety). xxx ref(data-rich-era)). Second, **machine learning** algorithms have revolutionized the way we can extract information from large volumes of data (Chapters \@ref(supervised_ml) - \@ref(interpretable_ml). Third, **Open Science** principles (Chapter \@ref(open_science)) - essential for inclusive research, boundless progress, and for diffusing science to society - are becoming a prerequisite for getting research funded and published (Chapter \@ref(open_science))). This course teaches you the skills to benefit from these developments.

-   What is data? How do we learn from data? What is a model (mechanistic vs statistic/empirical)?
    -   ML: Rules discovery in the data to be applied for new predictions. \"Traditional\": rules are encoded in a model (= hypothesis encoded in a model)

    -   a computer learn rules (from data) - opposite of a human specifying the rules and a computer applying them.

    -   Sympolic AI is based on rules. Works for computer playing chess, but not for fuzzy problems (image classification, speech recognition, language translation)
