# Overview {.unnumbered}

## About this book {.unnumbered}

This book serves as the basis for the courses in *Applied Geodata Science*, taught at the Institute of Geography, University of Bern. The starting point of this book were the tutorials edited by Benjamin Stocker, Loïc Pellissier, and Joshua Payne for the course *Environmental Systems Data Science* (D-USYS, ETH Zürich).

The target of this book are people interested in applying data science methods for research. Methods, example data sets, and prediction challenges are chosen to make the book most relatable to scientists and students in Geography and Environmental Sciences. No prior knowledge of coding is required. Respective essentials are briefly introduced as primers. The focus of this book is not on the theoretical basis of the methods. Other "classical" statistics courses serve this purpose. Instead, this book introduces essential concepts, methods, and tools for applied data science in Geography and Environmental Sciences with an emphasis on covering a wide breadth. It is written with a hands-on approach and should enable an intuitive understanding of concepts with only a minimal reliance on mathematical language. Worked examples are provided for typical steps of data science applications in Geography and Environmental Sciences. The aim of this book is to teach the diverse set of skills needed as a basis for data-intensive research (in academia and outside).

### Course goal {.unnumbered}

The overall goal of this set of courses is that students and other readers learn to **tell a story with (environmental and geo-) data**.

### Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

The overall learning objectives are:

-   Design and communicate your research project as a reproducible workflow.
    -   Find, access, process, and visualise large environmental and geographic data.
    -   Write legible code and manage collaborative code and data-centered projects.
    -   Manage analysis code for long-term reproducibility.
-   Identify, quantify, and interpret patterns in large environmental and geographic data.
    -   Devise suitable data visualisations.
    -   Determine suitable model formulations and implement effective model training.
    -   Describe the challenges of model fitting with large data.
-   Implement and make use of Open Science practices and resources to support data science projects in Geography and Environmental Sciences.

### Course contents {.unnumbered}

This course covers all steps along the data science workflow (see figure below) and introduces methods and tools to learn the most from data, to effectively communicate insights, and to make your workflow reproducible. By following this course, you will be well equipped for joining the Open Science movement.

Chapters \@ref(getting_started) and \@ref(programming_primers) serve as primers to get readers with a diverse background and data science experience up to speed with the basics for programming in R, which we rely on in later chapters.

Chapter \@ref(data-wrangling) introduces the efficient handling and cleaning of large tabular data with the R *tidyverse* "programming dialect". The focus is on non-geospatial data. Closely related to transforming data and its multiple axes of variation is the data visualisation, covered in Chapter \@ref(data-visualisation).

Chapters \@ref(data_variety), \@ref(code_mgmt), and \@ref(open_science) introduce essential tools for the daily work with diverse data and for an Open Science practice.

With Chapters \@ref(regression_classification), Chapter \@ref(supervised_ml_i), Chapter \@ref(supervised_ml_ii), and Chapter \@ref(random_forest), we will get into modelling and identifying patterns in the data.

Chapters 1-11 serve as lecture notes for Applied Geodata Science I and as learning material for students and scientists in any data-intensive research domain. These chapters are not explicitly dealing with geospatial data and modelling. Modelling with geospatial and temporal data is the subject of the course Applied Geodata Science II and will be introduced with a focus on typical applications and modelling tasks in Geography and Environmental Sciences. Respective materials are not currently contained in this book but will be added here later.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The sheer volume of data that is becoming available now bears a huge potential for answering long-standing questions in all fields of environmental and geo-sciences. This gives rise to a new set of tools that can be used and a new set of challenges when applying them. This course teaches you the basic concepts, methods, and tools for your future data science projects in environmental sciences - in academia and in the wild. The course thus prepares you to benefit from the general data richness in environmental and geo-sciences.

The course introduces the typical data science workflow using various examples of geographical and environmental data. With a strong hands-on component and a series of input lectures, the course introduces the basic concepts of data science and teaches how to conduct each step of the data science workflow. This includes the handling of various data formats, the formulation and fitting of robust statistical models, including basic machine learning algorithms, the effective visualisation and communication of results, and the implementation of reproducible workflows, founded in Open Science principles. The overall course goal is to teach students to tell a story with data.

All tutorials use the R programming language.

## What is Applied Geodata Science?

-   What is Data Science?
-   Why "Applied Geo-" Data Science?

## The (data) science workflow {#data-science-workflow}

The red thread of this course is the *data science workflow*. Applied (geodata-) data science projects typically start with research questions and hypotheses, and some data at hand, and (ideally) end with an answer to the research questions. What lies in between is not a linear process, but a cycle. One has to "understand" the data in order to identify appropriate analyses for answering the research questions. Such an understanding of the data is gradually established by repeated cycles of transforming the data, visualizing it, and modelling relationships. Before we've visualized the data, we don't know how to transform it. And before we've modeled it, we don't know the most appropriate visualization. In practice, we approach answers to our research questions gradually, through repeated cycles of *exploratory data analysis* [Fig. data-science-workflow].

[Fig. data-science-workflow]

As we work our way through repeated cycles of exploratory data analysis (Chapter \@ref(data-science-workflow)), we take decisions based on our data analysis, modelling, and visualizations. And we write code. The final conclusions we draw, the answers to research questions we find, and the results we communicate rest on the combination of all steps of our data processing, analysis, and visualization. Simply put, it rests on the reproducibility (and legibility) of our code. This course teaches you the tools and concepts to effectively learn from (large volumes of) data, and to put reproducibility of a geodata science project into practice.

## Why now? {#data-rich-era}

Three general developments set the stage for this course. First, Geography and Environmental Sciences (as many other realms of today's world) have entered a **data-rich era** (Chapters \@ref(data_variety). xxx ref(data-rich-era)). Second, **machine learning** algorithms have revolutionized the way we can extract information from large volumes of data (Chapters \@ref(supervised_ml) - \@ref(interpretable_ml). Third, **Open Science** principles (Chapter \@ref(open_science)) - essential for inclusive research, boundless progress, and for diffusing science to society - are becoming a prerequisite for getting research funded and published (Chapter \@ref(open_science))). This course teaches you the skills to benefit from these developments.

-   What is data? How do we learn from data? What is a model (mechanistic vs statistic/empirical)?
    -   ML: Rules discovery in the data to be applied for new predictions. "Traditional": rules are encoded in a model (= hypothesis encoded in a model)

    -   a computer learn rules (from data) - opposite of a human specifying the rules and a computer applying them.

    -   Sympolic AI is based on rules. Works for computer playing chess, but not for fuzzy problems (image classification, speech recognition, language translation)
