## Learning objectives

## Introduction

Code management is a key of managing any data science project, especially when collaborating. Proper code management limits mistakes such as code loss and increases efficiency by structuring (larger) projects.

In this section we will discuss the management of code in both the location sense, where things are kept, and tracking temporal changes over time or version control.

Current version control of code is dominated by the software tool `git`. However, version control has a long history and can be found not only in code development practices.

For example, whenever you use track changes in a text document you apply a form of version control i.e., you track changes in your text over time and selectively accepted changes. In this respect git, as a tool for version control of code, does not differ much from track changes of a text document.

Git allows for the collaboration of multiple people on the same code, while being consistent in how changes are implemented. Built upon git are cloud based platforms such as github, gitlab and codeberg which make these collaborative decisions and operations even easier.

In this section you will learn how to use git and github to manage your project and collaborate on code.

> NOTE: Coding style, and documentation practices of the code itself have been covered previously in the [programming primers]().
>
> Although the tutorial below focuses on github the jargon and operations are transferable to other platforms such as gitlab and codeberg.

### Location based code management

Both code (and data) management require you to be conscientious about where you store your code (and data). Structuring your projects using a the same template will allow you to understand where all pieces of an an analysis are stored.

In our [R project template](https://github.com/computationales/R_proj_template) we provide a project structure for both data and code which removes the mental overhead out of structuring data projects. This project structure sorts code, data and reporting in a consistent way.

You can use the template in combination with a github based version control approach to manage your projects. Simply create a new project from this template and clone the project to your local computer. Any changes to the project can be made by the workflows described above (commits etc).

To use the template create a new repository on github, as you otherwise would using the big green button. If you are in the project on github you can hit the green button top right (Use this template).

Otherwise you can select the repository from the template dropdown menu, select `computationales/R-project-template`.

Proceed as usual by naming your repository. However, be careful to select the correct owner of the project if you have multiple identities.

## Exercises

#### Location based code management

Create a github account (if you do not have one already).

Create a new R project using the R project template.

#### Github

This is a team exercise: team up with someone else in the classroom.

1.  Person 1 - clone the github project of Person 2

2.  Person 1 - create a new file in this project

3.  Person 1 - with changes made on github create a pull request

4.  Person 2 - review the pull request, and accept the pull request integrating new code in the project of Person 2

5.  Person 2 - add a new file to your own project, and update the github project

6.  Person 1 - integrate these changes in your project

To complete the exercise, reverse rolls between Person 1 and Person 2!
